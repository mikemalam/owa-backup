# Owa backup

Backup your email messagery using Outlook Web App even if you don't have the option enabled.
You will be asked the adress, your username, your password and the email you want to receive the link to download the .zip file (using dl.free.fr service).
Only the Inbox repository works.
I was tested on 14.3 version.

## Getting Started

Python3 must be installed. It has been tested on Linux and OS X but should be easy to run on Windows. 
You will also need to install all the libraries used (pip3 install or pip install xxx). 
"pip3 install unidecode pdfkit pyautogui selenium"
You will also need Firefox, GeckoDriver and wkhtmltopdf programs.
